Development
===========

Contributions
-------------

The code repository is hosted on `Github`_, testing, bug reports and contributions are highly welcomed and appreciated. Feel free to fork it and submit your PRs against the **develop** branch.

Development setup
-----------------------

The recommended development environment is based on **conda**.

First, clone the repository locally. You can use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone --branch develop git@github.com:ecmwf/earthkit-maps.git


Next, enter your git repository and run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    make conda-env-update
    conda activate earthkit-maps
    make setup
    pip install -e .

This will create a new conda environment called "earthkit-maps" with all the dependencies installed into it. This setup enables the `pre-commit`_ hooks, performing a series of quality control checks on every commit. If any of these checks fails the commit will be rejected.

Run unit tests
---------------

To run the test suite, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    pytest


Build documentation
-------------------

To build the documentation locally, please install the Python dependencies first:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd docs
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    make html

To see the generated HTML documentation open the ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` file in your browser.
